    <p>Slytherin corresponded roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals.<br> Similarly, in Celtic mythology, water is seen as a portal to another world, leading some to speculate that the element was chosen to symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pure-blood only community. <br>
    The colours also corresponded with waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being often associated with grey rainwater.</p>
