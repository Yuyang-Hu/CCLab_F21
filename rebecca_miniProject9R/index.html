    <h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmrxfSxeGPM">The Sorting Hat's Song</a></h1>
    <p>
Oh you may not think I'm pretty,<br>
But don't judge on what you see,<br>
I'll eat myself if you can find<br>
A smarter hat than me. <br><br>

You can keep your bowlers black,<br>
Your top hats sleek and tall,<br>
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat,<br>
And I can cap them all.<br><br>

There's nothing hidden in your head.<br>
The Sorting Hat can't see,<br>
So try me on and I will tell you<br>
Where you ought to be.<br><br></p>

<p id="g">You might belong in <a href="gryffindor.html">Gryffindor</a>,<br>
Where dwell the brave at heart,<br>
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry<br>
Set Gryffindors apart;
</p>

<p id="h">You might belong in <a href="hufflepuff.html">Hufflepuff</a>,<br>
Where they are just and loyal,<br>
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true<br>
And unafraid of toil;</p>

<p id="r">Or yet in wise old <a href="ravenclaw.html">Ravenclaw</a>,<br>
if you've a ready mind,<br>
Where those of wit and learning,<br>
Will always find their kind;<br>

<p id="s">
Or perhaps in <a href="slytherin.html">Slytherin</a>,<br>
You'll make your real friends,<br>
Those cunning folks use any means<br>
To achieve their ends.<br></p>

<p><br>
So put me on! Don't be afraid!<br>
And don't get in a flap!<br>
You're in safe hands (though I have none)<br>
For I'm a Thinking Cap!</p>
